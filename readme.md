Peachy Afternoon
================

This is a soft color scheme for Sublime Text 2 that is easy on the eyes (at least mine). There is no fancy theory behind the colors, just personal preference.

The background is often in need of adjustment, due to different screen settings.

	Hex     | Value/brightness
	\#4B4034 | 75 (default)
	\#463C31 | 70
	\#41382D | 65
	\#3C342A | 60
	\#373026 | 55
	\#322C23 | 50
